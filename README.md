**LEARN GIT LOCALLY**

This is for the last section of the *Git for Developers* course.

We initialized a git repo on our local machine and learned to use git locally. We created files, deleted files, learned to unstage, amend commits, deal with merge conflicts, and other intermediate-level git tactics. 

The course ended there, but I decided to host the class work to my GitHub.
